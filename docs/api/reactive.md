## reactive package

## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [SubscriptionController](./reactive.subscriptioncontroller.md) | Manages the subscription to tracked references and objects within a <code>memoized</code> function. |

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [derived(fn)](./reactive.derived.md) | Returns a [ReadonlyRef](./reactive.readonlyref.md) whose value will always point to the latest result of the given function. The function will only be executed once per set of values. |
|  [effect(fn)](./reactive.effect.md) | Sometimes your components will need to initiate side effects to start fetching data, etc. This function enables you to implement that behaviour. The provided <code>effect</code> will be observed and will run automatically whenever any of its tracked values change. It will automatically be invalidated when the component is unmounted.<!-- -->The function passed into <code>effect</code> will behave similarly to one that is passed to Reacts <code>useEffect</code> in that it won't be executed during server side rendering. |
|  [fromHook(fn)](./reactive.fromhook.md) | The function passed to <code>fromHook</code> will always be executed when rendering the component. |
|  [inject(context)](./reactive.inject.md) | Injects a React.Context into a Reactive Function Component. |
|  [memoize(fn, controller)](./reactive.memoize.md) | Returns a function that is only executed again if any of its tracked values have changed. The <code>controller</code> can be used to establish a notification system and is largely irrelevant to end users of the API. |
|  [r(render)](./reactive.r.md) | This function is a pure type-cast to avoid TypeScript from complaining when using a Reactive Function Component without [wrap()](./reactive.wrap.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [reactive(initialValue)](./reactive.reactive.md) | Transforms an object into a tracked version. Changing the object returned from <code>reactive</code> will also change the original. All watchers and derived values will update. Access to <code>Object.keys</code> as well as checking for the existance of a key through the <code>in</code> operator will also be tracked. |
|  [readonly(ref)](./reactive.readonly.md) | Converts a mutable [Ref](./reactive.ref.md) to a [ReadonlyRef](./reactive.readonlyref.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [ref(initialValue)](./reactive.ref.md) | Creates a new tracked reference value. |
|  [toRef(store, prop)](./reactive.toref.md) | Extracts a single property from a tracked object into a [RefObject](./reactive.refobject.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [toRefs(store)](./reactive.torefs.md) | Converts a tracked object into an object of [Ref](./reactive.ref.md) instances. |
|  [useRefValue(ref)](./reactive.userefvalue.md) | Returns the current value of a [RefObject](./reactive.refobject.md) and starts to track its value once the component has been mounted.<!-- -->An update will be scheduled if the value of the reference has changed between the first render of the component and mounting it. |
|  [watchEffect(fn)](./reactive.watcheffect.md) | Executes the given effect immediately and tracks any used values. When any of them change, it will execute the effect again. If a <code>teardown</code> function has been registered through the <code>onInvalidate</code> param, it will be executed before the effect is executed again, allowing for cleanup. |
|  [wrap(construct)](./reactive.wrap.md) | Converts a Reactive Function Component into a React Function Component. A Reactive Function Component returns a render function which is automatically tracked. If none of its input values have changed, the <code>render</code> function will not execute during consequitive renderings of the component. Instead, the old virtual DOM tree will be returned, enabling frameworks like React and Preact to bail out of rendering early on.<!-- -->It is usually a better developer experience to configure your Build tool to use <code>@pago/reactive</code> as the <code>@jsxImportSource</code> or the <code>@jsxFactory</code>. |

## Interfaces

|  Interface | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [Effect](./reactive.effect.md) | A function that represents a pure side effect with no input and no output. |
|  [ReadonlyRef](./reactive.readonlyref.md) | A tracked reference to a value that can't be modified. |
|  [Ref](./reactive.ref.md) | A tracked reference to a value. Reading it from it should mark it as "read" in the current scope, writing to it should mark it as dirty.<!-- -->When a <code>Ref</code> is marked as dirty, any watcher or derivative will eventually be updated to its new value.<!-- -->Note that it is not possible to read and update a ref within the same tracked scope. |
|  [RefObject](./reactive.refobject.md) | An Ref object that supports reading &amp; writing in the same tracked scope by providing a specific [RefObject.update()](./reactive.refobject.update.md) method. |

## Variables

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [createElement](./reactive.createelement.md) | An interceptor for the standard React <code>createElement</code> function from the <code>react</code> package. |
|  [jsx](./reactive.jsx.md) | An interceptor for the standard React <code>jsx</code> function from the <code>react/jsx-runtime</code> package. |
|  [jsxs](./reactive.jsxs.md) | An interceptor for the standard React <code>jsxs</code> function from the <code>react/jsx-runtime</code> package. |

## Type Aliases

|  Type Alias | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [RefContainer](./reactive.refcontainer.md) | An object with only [RefObject](./reactive.refobject.md) values. |
|  [Store](./reactive.store.md) | An object that inlines all [Ref](./reactive.ref.md) values and enables using them transparently. |
