## reactive() function

Transforms an object into a tracked version. Changing the object returned from `reactive` will also change the original. All watchers and derived values will update. Access to `Object.keys` as well as checking for the existance of a key through the `in` operator will also be tracked.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function reactive<T extends object>(initialValue: T): Store<T>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  initialValue | T | The underlying object |

<b>Returns:</b>

## Remarks

When a tracked object is destructed, all tracking information is lost. Instead of destructuring a `reactive` object, you need to first convert it with [toRefs()](./reactive.torefs.md)<!-- -->.

## Example

Original object is mutated when the reactive object is mutated.

```js
const originalState = { message: 'hello' };
const state = reactive(originalState);
state.message = 'ciao';
console.log(originalState.message); // => 'ciao'

```
